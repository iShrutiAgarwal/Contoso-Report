# Project Title- CONTOSO REPORT

## About Report
This is a data visualization project using Power BI. I developed this dashboard report as part of my Data Visualization course learning.

I performed data modelling along with Power Query editing and used DAX Measures for the analysis and finally conceptualized them together to display a summarized study of the sales data used.
The Dashboard consists of several charts, filters, KPIs for a quick view of the Contoso's data analysis.
